# Spoony

Spoony is a tool to generate step routes for the SNES/SFC release of Final
Fantasy IV.

## Prerequisites

Spoony may or may not build in your particular environment. The code should be
standard C++14 and as such, should compile on any standards-compliant compiler.
However, the build is currently only tested on Clang 3.8 with the Gold linker,
and the included build machinery assumes as much.

## Acknowledgements

Many of the original ideas for Spoony came from work done by the_roth and
Myself086 with their own step routing work. Additional ideas, especially related
to this rewrite came from fcoughlin.

The entire FF4 speed running community has been incredibly supportive not only
by providing information and by helping with research, but also by actually
using the generated routes in runs to help prove their viability.
